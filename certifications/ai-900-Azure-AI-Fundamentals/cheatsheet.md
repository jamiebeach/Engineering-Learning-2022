## Describe fundamental principles of machine learning on Azure (30-35%)

### Identify common machine learning types
- [ ] identify regression machine learning scenarios
    - Predicted vs. True shows the relationship between a predicted value and its correlating true value for a regression problem.
- [ ] identify classification machine learning scenarios
- [ ] identify clustering machine learning scenarios

### Describe core machine learning concepts
- [ ] identify features and labels in a dataset for machine learning

    - **Features**: Data values that influence prediction of a model.
        - Example: if predicting fares of taxi trips, could use things like distance travelled or length of time in taxi as features.
    - The *Split Data module* is particularly useful when you need to separate data into training and testing sets. Use the Split Rows option if you want to divide the data into two parts. You can specify the percentage of data to put in each split, but by default, the data is divided 50-50.
    - [*Feature engineering*](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/team-data-science-process/create-features) is used to generate additional features.

- [ ] describe how training and validation datasets are used in machine learning

    - **Unvupervised Learning** : Ability to find patterns in data without human help.
    - **Supervised Learning** : Humans label the data and give general guidance.

- [ ] describe how machine learning algorithms are used for model training
- [ ] select and interpret model evaluation metrics for classification and regression

### Identify core tasks in creating a machine learning solution
- [ ] describe common features of data ingestion and preparation
- [ ] describe feature engineering and selection
- [ ] describe common features of model training and evaluation
- [ ] describe common features of model deployment and management

### Describe capabilities of no-code machine learning with Azure Machine Learning studio
- [ ] automated ML UI

    - [**Confusion matrices**](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/how-to-understand-automated-ml#confusion-matrix) provide a visual for how a machine learning model is making systematic errors in its predictions for classification models. The word "confusion" in the name comes from a model "confusing" or mislabeling samples.
        - Identifies how many times evaluated results differ from expected labels
        - Confusion matrix for a good model would show most results along the diagonal (ie most evaluations == expected labels).
        - In a *binary classification* algorithm, the concept of false negatives, true positives, true negatives and false positives exists.
            - Where the algo predicts a positive (1) and the actual is also positive (1) then it is a true positive.
            - if predicts negative (0) and actual is positive (1) then it is a false negative (falsely predicting negative).
            - if predicts positive and actual negative, then false positive.
            - if predicts negative and actual negative, then true negative.
            - [See this article](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/azure/machine-learning/classic/evaluate-model-performance#inspecting-the-evaluation-results-1).
