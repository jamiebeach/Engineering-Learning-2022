- Continued down az104 path with attempting a practice exam on whizlabs. Only went through half the questions but managed to get nearly all of them. Mostly policies, locks, moving resources, etc...
- Also went through the rest of the networking course videos on whizlabs for the same az104.
- Listened to latest Cloudcast and [Azure podcasts](https://www.podchaser.com/podcasts/the-azure-podcast-725242/episodes/episode-410-fusion-dev-128109256).
